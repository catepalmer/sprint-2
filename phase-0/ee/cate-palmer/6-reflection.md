- What did I do well this sprint?

I solved problems I was having writing my Minesweeper code by looking at other 
people's solutions (inspecting their code in the console) and using this to 
figure out what I needed to do.


- What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't do especially well at figuring out the logic of the code I needed to write 
on my own - I struggled to do this while also remembering the syntax of various 
different techniques in Javascript.


- What can I improve on next sprint?

Spend a bit longer unpacking the different parts of other people's code and researching 
how it works using the internet (as a learning exercise).
