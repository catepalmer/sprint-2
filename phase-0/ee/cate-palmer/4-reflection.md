- What did I do well this sprint?

I think I had fairly good time management for this sprint, and it helped that I had a few days free to get it all done in one chunk (it also helped that it was a lot smaller than sprint 3, and harder to get stuck going down perfectionistic tangents).


- What didn't I do well this sprint?

My focus and concentration could've been better at times when learning some of the tougher JavaScript concepts, but I feel like all I was really after was getting a decent-enough overview, and I think I achieved that.


- What can I improve on next sprint?

Maybe making more notes would be helpful - I just moved house and can't find the exercise book I was making notes in, and I think maybe it would be helpful if I just started using a different one instead of waiting to find my old one.
