- What did I do well this sprint?

I tried to work through the problems I came across myself rather than immediately asking for help (and managed to solve them on my own). I also went back and did some further study on the concepts that were being convered because I realised I didn't understand them well enough to meaningfully engage with them.


- What didn't I do well this sprint?

I can't think of anything much.


What can I improve on next sprint?

- I think I can keep working on learning how to investigate problems myself and solve them by working through them methodically rather than instantly asking for help from others.
