- What did I do well this sprint?

Reading through the resources quickly first to get an overview before spending a bit more time unpacking them - being efficient with my time.

Zoning out and getting bored during the video resources (and not really taking enough in as a result).

- What can I improve on next sprint?

Taking notes while engaging with resources in order to make sure I'm taking in the necessary information.
