1. Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command line is a way of interacting with your computer that involves writing lines of text (commands) into a programme that issues them to your computer, rather than interacting with the computer's graphical user interface (what you usually see on a computer screen - menus, folders, files, etc that you can open, create, delete, move, etc). It's basically a way of doing the same stuff you would usually do on a computer, except it looks really different and isn't as self-explanatory as interacting with your computer using the graphical user interface. It also gives you much more nerd cred.


2. List 10 terminal commands and in plain English (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

cd - Change directory. This basically allows you to move between different folders that are nested within each other (a directory is the same thing as a folder).

mkdir - This allows you to make a new directory (i.e. a folder).

ls - This command means 'list', and if you use it the command line will tell you everything that's in the folder you're currently in.

pwd - This means 'print working directory', and is a fancy way of saying 'Tell me which folder I'm currently in.'

touch - This command, followed by a new file name, allows you to create a new file inside the folder you're currently in.

sort - This command allows you to sort the lines inside a file in alphabetical order from top to bottom.

rm - This means 'remove', and when followed by a file name it allows you to delete a file inside the folder you're currently in.

mv - This command means 'move', and you can follow it with various different configurations of file names and folder names that allow you to move a file or folder or rename a file.

cp - This command means 'copy', and when followed by various things it allows you to copy files into folders, copy and rename a file, etc.

grep - This command allows you to search for particular pieces of text inside a file or within file names inside a folder.
